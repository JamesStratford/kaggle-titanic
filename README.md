# Titanic Kaggle Competition

This is my first entry and attempt in a Kaggle competiion using the Titanic survival dataset.

My submission ranked #840 in the world with a accuracy score of 0.79425.

In this Jupyter notebook I created 3 models:

* Decision Tree
* Artificial Neural Network
* k Nearest Neighbour

Ultimately I went with an MLP model with two hidden layers (12, 13) and 150 iterations.
